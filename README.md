I’m proud of my work on Mock-IELTS (https://mock-ielts.com/), an AI-powered platform designed for IELTS practice. One of the key features I developed for this project is a fully custom Quill Editor, which allows admins to add and format questions with ease.


This editor includes:
✔️ Fully customized select, radio buttons, tables, and other formatting options
✔️ A smooth and intuitive interface for managing questions
✔️ Deep integration with the admin panel for seamless content creation

It was a challenging but rewarding project, and I’m especially proud of how flexible and user-friendly the editor turned out to be! 🚀
